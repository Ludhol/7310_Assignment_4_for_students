If you are reading this it means that you have succesfully installed python (programming language), pip (package manager for python) and jupyter notebooks. Well done - you're on your way to being a coder!\n",

The goal of version control is to make sure that a projekt always has a stable state to get back to when making changes. It is used by most programming teams around the world. Github is a service that allows you to save your code in the cloud and have multiple people working on the project locally at the same time. Git is the system for implementing local changes to the online code. Github was purchased by Microsoft in 2018 for 7.5 billion dollars - together with the acquistion of LinkedIn in 2016 (for 26.2 billion dollars) Microsoft now has access to a large portion of the worlds code and proffesional networks. Think about this when you hear the term FANG (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google).\n",

If changes are detected pull attempts to download and merge the changes with the version of the code that is on your machine.
